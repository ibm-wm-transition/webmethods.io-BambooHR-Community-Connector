## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
This connector requires any [Node](https://nodejs.org/dist/) version between 8.14.0 and 10.14.2.

Note: If you have installed any other Node version on your system, you can:
1. Use tools to switch between different versions of Node

  - For Windows, use [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#installation--upgrades).
  
  - For Mac, use [homebrew](https://brew.sh/).
2. Build your app using your existing Node version and then transpile your code using a transpiler like [Babel](https://babeljs.io/).

The connector has been built with [wmiocli](https://docs.webmethods.io/integration/developer_guide/connector_builder/#gsc.tab=0), webmethod.io's iPaaS Connector Builder CLI tool, which must be installed. 

### Getting the API key 
To generate an API key, users should log in to their BambooHR account and click their name in the upper right-hand corner of any page to get to the user context menu. If they have sufficient permissions, there will be an "API Keys" option in that menu to go to the page. Each user may have one or more secret API keys that identify that user to the API.

### Installing
1. Clone the repo `https://github.com/yuvanmytri/webmethods.io-BambooHR-Community-Connector.git`.
2. Run `npm install -g @webmethodsio/wmiocli`.
3. Login to your webmethods.io tenant using `wmio login`.
4. Execute `wmio init` to get started.
5. Finally, execute `wmio deploy` to deploy this connector to your tenant.

Once deployed, it’ll be automatically registered with webMethods.io Integration and will be available to you locally in the Connectors panel under the Services tab.

## Running the tests
To test, you can execute `wmio test`.

## Deployment
Execute `wmio deploy` to deploy this connector to your webmethods.io tenant. And `wmio unpublish` to unpublish the published connector app along with triggers and actions associated with the app.
